            Also if a user left out a field, it would also send a error message saying you can't leave the field blank. Furthermore, in order to test  the severside the user would need to type in question mark (?) first and then type in noval=y. </p>

        <p>To test the api, you would simply type in a post then submit it. The post which you have entered will automatically go into the table. It would thenallow users to like posts. For example, just press the like button, next to the post. 
            
            When you type an address or submit data via a browser window, you would be making a server request, via the user interface. This is known as the API â€” or Application Programming Interface. Instead of sending a request and receiving data via HTML and having the results displayed as a web page, using APIs to send the request and receive the result in a format like JSON, which can then be used directly inside of other programs, to make it a lot easier. </p>
